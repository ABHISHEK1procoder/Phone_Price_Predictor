# 📱 Mobile Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **price range** of mobile phones based on their specifications using a **Machine Learning model** built with **Logistic Regression**.  
It is deployed using **Streamlit** for an interactive and user-friendly web interface.

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of this project is to help users estimate the price category of a mobile phone by analyzing its features such as battery capacity, RAM, camera quality, screen size, and connectivity options.

The model classifies phones into four categories:

| Code | Price Category |
|------|----------------|
| 0 | Low Cost 💰 |
| 1 | Medium Cost 💵 |
| 2 | High Cost 💸 |
| 3 | Very High Cost 💎 |

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, streamlit, joblib  
- **Data Split:** 80% training, 20% testing  
- **Scaler Used:** StandardScaler (saved as `scalar.joblib`)  
- **Model File:** `mobile_price_model.pkl`  
- **Accuracy:** **96.5%** on test data

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The model is trained on mobile specifications using Logistic Regression.
2. The input data is scaled using **StandardScaler** to maintain consistency.
3. Users enter mobile specifications in the Streamlit interface.
4. The model predicts the **price category** of the phone in real-time.
